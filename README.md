# Operating System Algorithms Repository

Welcome to the Operating System Algorithms Repository! This repository contains implementations of various operating system scheduling algorithms in C++. Whether you're a student studying operating systems or a developer looking to understand these algorithms better, this repository aims to provide clear and concise implementations along with explanations to aid your learning.

## Algorithms Implemented

1. **[Round Robin Scheduler](round_robin/README.md)**: This algorithm is a preemptive scheduler where each process is assigned a fixed time slice or quantum. Once a process consumes its quantum, it's moved to the back of the ready queue to await its turn again. This implementation demonstrates how round-robin scheduling can be achieved efficiently in C++.

2. **[Priority Scheduler](priority_scheduler/README.md)**: Priority scheduling assigns priorities to each process, and the CPU is allocated to the process with the highest priority. In case of ties, a round-robin approach can be used. This implementation showcases how to implement priority scheduling and handle priorities effectively.

3. **[Shortest Job First (SJF)](shortest_job_first/README.md)**: SJF scheduling algorithm selects the process with the smallest execution time next. This implementation demonstrates how to implement SJF scheduling in C++.

4. **[First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)](https://github.com/Pulkit1822/CSE3003-Operating_System/tree/main/FCFS)**: FCFS scheduling algorithm executes processes in the order they arrive in the ready queue. This implementation demonstrates how to implement FCFS scheduling in C++.

(Add more algorithms and descriptions as needed)

## How to Use

Each algorithm implementation is contained within its own directory along with a README file explaining the algorithm's logic and how to use the implementation. To use any algorithm:

1. Navigate to the respective algorithm's directory.
2. Follow the instructions provided in the README to compile and run the code.
3. Experiment with different inputs and configurations to observe the behavior of the algorithm.
