## Summary
The code snippet is a part of a program that demonstrates the producer-consumer problem using semaphores in C++. It creates a semaphore, initializes it, and then forks a child process. The child process acts as the producer, generating random items and adding them to a shared buffer. The parent process acts as the consumer, removing items from the buffer and consuming them. The semaphore is used to synchronize access to the buffer, ensuring that only one process can access it at a time.

## Example Usage
```cpp
// Create a key for the semaphore
key_t key = ftok(".", 'a');

// Create a semaphore with the specified key
semaphoreID = createSemaphore(key, 1);

// Fork a child process
pid_t pid = fork();

// If the process is the child, act as the producer
if (pid == 0) {
    for (int i = 0; i < ITEMS_TO_PRODUCE; i++) {
        produceItem();
    }
}
// If the process is the parent, act as the consumer
else {
    for (int i = 0; i < ITEMS_TO_PRODUCE; i++) {
        consumeItem();
    }
}
```

## Code Analysis
### Inputs
- `key`: A key used to create the semaphore.
- `nsems`: The number of semaphores to create.
___
### Flow
1. The code defines a union `my_semun` to hold semaphore values.
2. The `createSemaphore` function is called to create a semaphore with the specified key and initialize it to 1.
3. The `waitSemaphore` function is called to decrement the semaphore value by 1, blocking if the value is already 0.
4. The `signalSemaphore` function is called to increment the semaphore value by 1.
5. The `produceItem` function generates a random item, adds it to the buffer, and signals the semaphore.
6. The `consumeItem` function waits for the semaphore, removes an item from the buffer, and signals the semaphore.
7. The `main` function creates a key using `ftok` and creates a semaphore with the key.
8. The `fork` function is called to create a child process.
9. If the process is the child, it calls `produceItem` to produce items.
10. If the process is the parent, it calls `consumeItem` to consume items.
___
### Outputs
- The producer process prints the items it produces.
- The consumer process prints the items it consumes.
